# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
A simple Rock–Paper–Scissors game written in C++. The player chooses between Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer selects a random choice. The game runs for a number of rounds selected by the user (1–10), and shows the winner of each round as well as the final results.  This project is part of my practice to improve my C++ programming skills.
